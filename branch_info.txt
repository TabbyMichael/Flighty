FEATURE MESSAGE:
feat: Implement comprehensive rate limiting and caching for backend API

FEATURE DESCRIPTION:
This branch introduces robust rate limiting and caching mechanisms to enhance the performance, security, and reliability of the Flight Booking backend API. 

Key improvements include:

1. Rate Limiting Implementation:
   - Integrated SlowAPI for flexible rate limiting across all API endpoints
   - Configurable rate limits for different endpoint categories:
     * Authentication: 10 requests/minute
     * Flight searches: 30 requests/minute
     * Bookings: 20 requests/minute
     * Airport/Airline info: 50 requests/minute
     * Webhooks: 20 requests/minute
     * Admin operations: 100 requests/minute
   - Global rate limit of 100 requests/minute as safety net
   - Proper HTTP 429 responses with retry-after headers
   - Configurable rate limiting settings via environment variables

2. Caching System Enhancement:
   - Implemented Redis-based caching for improved performance
   - Flight search results caching with parameter-based cache keys
   - Airport and airline information caching
   - Automatic cache invalidation for data updates
   - Configurable cache expiration times
   - Pattern-based cache invalidation for bulk operations

3. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   - Comprehensive test suite with 37 tests covering all new functionality
   - Unit tests for cache operations and rate limit configuration
   - Integration tests for API endpoint rate limiting and caching
   - Performance testing to validate improvements
   - Edge case handling and error condition testing

4. Documentation:
   - Updated API documentation with rate limit information
   - Configuration guides for cache settings
   - Implementation details for future maintenance

These enhancements provide:
- Protection against API abuse and DDoS attacks
- Improved response times through intelligent caching
- Better resource utilization and scalability
- Enhanced user experience with faster API responses
- Robust foundation for future feature development

The implementation follows industry best practices and maintains full backward compatibility with existing client applications.
